Here's a poem about nature:

**Whispers of the Wild**

The forest whispers secrets in my ear,
Of ancient trees, and leaves so clear.
Their branches sway, like dancing hands,
As sunlight filters through the leafy stands.

A gentle brook babbles, crystal bright,
Reflecting skyward, with sparkling light.
Its waters flow, a soothing melody,
Calming soul and heart, wild and free.

The wind stirs high, with whispers soft,
Of distant mountains, where eagles aloft.
Their cries echo through the morning air,
As nature awakens, without a care.

In forest depths, a hidden world is found,
Where rabbits dart, and squirrels spin around.
Their tiny lives, a joy to behold,
A symphony of wonder, worth more than gold.

The earthy scent, of moss and loam,
Fills lungs with freshness, and awakens my soul's home.
In this wild tapestry, I find my peace,
A sense of belonging, in nature's release.

So let me wander, through the woods so grand,
And listen to the whispers, of this wondrous land.
For in its heart, a beauty lies in store,
A symphony of wonder, forever more.
