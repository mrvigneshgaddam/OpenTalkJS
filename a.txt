Here's a poem about nature:

**Whispers of the Wild**

The forest whispers secrets deep,
Of ancient trees that quietly sleep.
Their leaves rustle, a gentle breeze,
That stirs the heart with peaceful ease.

The sun shines bright, its warm rays dance,
Upon the earth, a vibrant prance.
The flowers bloom, their colors bold,
A rainbow's splendor, young and old.

The river flows, a winding stream,
That echoes songs of nature's dream.
Its waters lap, against the shore,
A soothing melody evermore.

The mountains stand, majestic high,
Their peaks touching the clouds in the sky.
Their rugged grandeur, awe-inspiring sight,
Invites the soul to soar and take flight.

In nature's arms, we find our peace,
A sense of calm, a world to cease.
From the earth's vast beauty, we are free,
To breathe, to live, to simply be.

The stars appear, a twinkling sea,
A celestial show, for you and me.
Their gentle sparkle, a guiding light,
Leads us through life's darkest night.

Nature's whispers, a symphony so grand,
Remind us of wonder, in this land.
Her beauty is, a gift to behold,
A treasure, worth more than gold.
