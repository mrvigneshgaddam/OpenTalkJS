Here's a poem about nature:

The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue, that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall, their leaves rustling free,
A gentle breeze whispers secrets to me.

The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks reaching high, for the morning light.
The rivers flow, with waters pure and bright,
Reflecting beauty, in every quiet night.

In fields of green, wildflowers sway,
Dancing gently, to the wind's sweet play.
A symphony of life, where creatures roam,
Free from care, in their natural home.

The stars appear, like diamonds bright,
A celestial show, in all its might.
The world is full, of wonder and might,
A treasure trove, of nature's delight.

So let us cherish, this gift so rare,
This earth we live on, with love and care.
For in its beauty, we find our peace,
And a sense of wonder, that will never cease.
