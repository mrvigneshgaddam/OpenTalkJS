Here's a poem about nature:

**Whispers of the Earth**

The forest whispers secrets low,
Of ancient trees and memories that glow.
Their leaves rustle, a gentle hush,
As sunbeams filter through, in a soft rush.

The mountains stand, majestic and tall,
Their peaks kissed by clouds, their valleys enthrall.
Rivers flow, like lifeblood's stream,
Through canyons deep, where echoes beam.

In meadows green, wildflowers sway,
Dancing to breezes that whisper, "Stay."
Butterflies flit, with wings of hue,
A kaleidoscope of color anew.

The ocean's roar, a constant beat,
Echoes through tides, in endless repeat.
Seagulls soar, on wings outstretched and wide,
Free spirits born, of the sea's dark side.

In nature's heart, a symphony plays,
Of life, of death, of seasons' sway.
A dance of growth, of decay and birth,
A never-ending cycle, of earth and mirth.

So let us breathe in deep, the scents of the land,
And listen to the whispers of the forest hand.
For in nature's beauty, we find our peace,
A reflection of the world's release.
